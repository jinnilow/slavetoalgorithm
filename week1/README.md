## In Class Activity - Understanding Algorithms (Group 3)

In this algorithm, we wanted to create six different categories based on different things. The first was numbers, then followed by textures, direction, colours, animals, and (ugly or debatable) typefaces. It was all completely random and I guess in our heads it seemed more picturesque than the outcomes. We were working towards a final, random canvas artwork.

So, we would roll the dice six times and collect these data to form an artwork. In total, we did three whole rounds to create three drawings each. All of us had similar elements for each round, but because we all drew our own individual artwork, our outcomes slightly differed.

Through this exercise, it was definitely easier to understand how parametric design work. By setting ‘parameters’ or structured rules of some sort, these artworks could be randomly generated according to the rules. Of course, I would hope for the computer generated outcomes to be much better than my drawings. I have also realised that parametric systems can be non-computational as well.

Through looking at other group’s processes, it was interesting to see how different their artworks were. One group did heads & faces and another did drawings with different parts of their bodies. It was interesting to see how generative design can be used under many different circumstances, as long as you have a goal and set of rules.


## Artist Research

As much as I love looking at David Szakaly and Raven Kwok’s visual art pieces and 3D designs, I cannot stop thinking about Lauren McCarthy’s work. One example Karen showed us,‘us+’, is to me, a very positive example of how this new tech can help a lot of us with our social cues and help us realise how we might come off as. It is also interesting to realise and think how algorithms come to play with these projects.  

I then went ahead to check out her other works and found too many interesting ones, working around the constructs of social relationships - which I then discovered was what she based most or all of her work on. These are particularly the ones that I couldn’t stop thinking about.

Some of it, I couldn’t help but feel unsettled yet somewhat relatable, which made me feel unsettled again. 
For example, her work “Follower” which takes a social media follower into a real life one, made me feel very repelled at the start. It felt almost like it was an invasion of privacy and I couldn't understand why anyone would want that. However, the more I looked into it, the more I found myself actually wanting the experience, which made me then question a lot about myself or and how these social relationships actually play a part in my life or how I think. 

Another instance is 'pplkpr', which is an app that tracks and helps you manage your relationships by tracking your interactions and helping you decide if someone is right for you or not. Personally, I thought it was a genius ideas as it would give me a definitive excuse as to why I would choose not to hang out with someone anymore. However, I can’t help but think of how much the algorithms or AI(?), again plays a role in deciding something for me. Although I do know that in a more positive light, the technology does help in a lot of ways too. 

A piece that I really like visually and conceptually is 'Changing Room'. I thought the way she used the light, visuals, cues etc were so genius in creating an emotion for everyone present. The interactivity, the togetherness of everyone experiencing something somewhat made me feel warm. Although, in saying that, the possibility of algorithms  AI controlling how we feel is to me again, unsettling. Her works remind me of the show 'Black Mirror' (a show that talks about a dystopian reality and the consequences of technology). 

I do really admire her works as an artist and find her projects and concepts very intriguing. I want to find out how she does what she does.
