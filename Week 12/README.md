# Week 12

## Sketch Progress

Before my consultation with Karen and Andy, I really wanted to change the ideas for my visuals because I was so unsure with how everything was going (visually). After consultation though, I decided to go forward with what I already have since I do not have much time left, plus Andy did suggest that framing will help with making the sketch look neater.

So I created a list just to make sure that I knew why I chose certain visuals for each emotion.

## LOVE

With this emotion, I represented it last week with a flower like, bright pink visual. I really liked it, but I still felt like changing it. To me love, should multiply instead of a big round object.

<br /> <br /> 

So, I decided to revisit the flower sketch, and make it a little thicker just because I felt the dots were also interfering with the excited visual, and wanted it to look more filled. I generated a few multiple flower images from the sketch, then animated the generated flowers by uploading the flower as an image and multiplying them on screen while rotating them in random sizes.

## HAPPY

With this emotion, I initially used this radiating circle to express happiness, and I’m not sure why.

<br /> <br /> 

I tried a few other sketches too, like the Phyllotaxis pattern in week 10 but it didn’t seem to work on the slider. So I revisited the mathematical rose iterations I did for the feeling of love, and decided to change the shape and make it yellow, to make it look like a happy sunflower.

## EXCITED

For this feeling, I wanted to show a burst of energy, and tried a few sketches to see which represented it the best. 
<br /> <br />

<br /> <br /> 

However, I came across this [sketch by Richard Bourne](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/942516), where he used 3D shapes to wiggle in a sphere, and I thought that looked amazing! I really dig the colours too. So, I remixed it to both the feeling of excited and anger. 

With excitement, I changed the size and width of the cylinders to make it look like confetti and used brighter and more positive looking colours to communicate the feeling of excitement. I also spaced the elements out instead of having them in a sphere.

## ANGER

Before I found the sketch by Richard Bourne, I had a few iterations that I did to communicate this feeling. One was the crazy lines I did in week 10, and another was a burst of random shapes in red and black.

However, none of them was reaching and so with the sketch I found, I remixed the shapes into cones as they had this pointy sharp edge that reminds me of that angry feeling.

## ANXIOUS

With the feeling of anxious, I was really stuck with how I could communicate this feeling. I did a few iterations but I felt like it could be communicated better. So, I decided to go on the web to look at how people describe the feeling of anxiousness, and the one phrase that got my attention was how it felt like a heavy rain of clouds, clouding your thoughts and making you feel trapped. That got me creating the third sketch, having the idea of these blurred clouds that will soon cloud the other sketches when you increase the feeling of anxiety.

## SAD

Sad still remained the same from Week 10; I just randomised the colours so the rain looked more dynamic and less flat.
