## Processing in class

In this week’s class, we had a full-on processing session where we learnt how to include images and interactive elements in it, as well as including text and rotating it into a short animation. <br />

There were so many new functions and ideas that we have learnt in this class. For example for the sketch that included our image, we use the random function - which was really interesting to figure and learn and which I feel would be integrated into our upcoming projects as well, along with the mapping function, which is a really cool function to know as it can be used to map anything basically. And lastly, the get function, which reads the colour on any pixel and the transparent function… <br />

Together, we created a sketch that builds an image slowly, depending on where the cursor is, (as the different x direction of the cursor would produce a different circle size, and opacity as well, which would then affect the speed of the formation of the image). <br />

Here was how mine looked like in the process. <br />

In the next example, Karen taught us how to include text in our sketches, and to rotate them while fading at the same time… As well as creating shapes around the rotation… We learnt about the smooth function, how to load a font, and to rotate the text, which enforced our memory from the previous weeks as well, when Karen first taught us how to rotate an object. It was a nice feeling to be able to understand what went on this time round. <br />

To make things more advanced, we then created a sketch where we could draw the letters, and we could change the background colour as well. We learnt how to set random variables (to create random characters, size, colours)  as well as for integers and floats. There was so much to learn, and I definitely want to explore these functions further and try to create my own artwork. <br />
