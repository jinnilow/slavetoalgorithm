# Week 4 Content

## Processing in class

In this week’s class, we had a full-on processing session where we learnt how to include images and interactive elements in it, as well as including text and rotating it into a short animation. <br />

There were so many new functions and ideas that we have learnt in this class. For example for the sketch that included our image, we use the random function - which was really interesting to figure and learn and which I feel would be integrated into our upcoming projects as well, along with the mapping function, which is a really cool function to know as it can be used to map anything basically. And lastly, the get function, which reads the colour on any pixel and the transparent function… <br />

Together, we created a [sketch](https://github.com/jinnilow/slavetoalgorithm/tree/master/Processing/photo_Jinni) that builds an image slowly, depending on where the cursor is, (as the different x direction of the cursor would produce a different circle size, and opacity as well, which would then affect the speed of the formation of the image). <br />

Here was how mine looked like in the process. <br />

<br /> 
In the next example, Karen taught us how to include text in our sketches, and to rotate them while fading at the same time… As well as creating shapes around the rotation… We learnt about the smooth function, how to load a font, and to rotate the text, which enforced our memory from the previous weeks as well, when Karen first taught us how to rotate an object. It was a nice feeling to be able to understand what went on this time round. <br />

<br /> 
<br /> 
To make things more advanced, we then created a [sketch](https://github.com/jinnilow/slavetoalgorithm/tree/master/Processing/draw_font) where we could draw the letters, and we could change the background colour as well. We learnt how to set random variables (to create random characters, size, colours)  as well as for integers and floats. There was so much to learn, and I definitely want to explore these functions further and try to create my own artwork. <br />

## Brainstorming session & research 

Throughout week 4 (before this week's class), I did my own brainstorming sessions for the topics and processes that I want to dive into deeper for the project pitch. As Andy suggested, I created a list of topics that I would be interested in as well as processes & outputs that I would love to show. This definitely helped with obtain a rough idea of what I want my speculative project to be. <br /> 
<br />

<br /> <br /> 

So from this, I have learnt that I definitely want my input to be data driven or either through sense as well. And for my processes, I would be interested in learning more on processing, generative/ parametric designs and machine learning. As for my output I was thinking definitely some sort of interactive art which might include light projections/ data sculptures/ immersive digital experience. <br /> 

As for my topic, I wanted to definitely dive into the idea of memory more, or more on how the brain works and perceive things. So I started diving into my top 3 topics and researching more into them. <br /> 
<br />

<br />  
<br /> 

From my brainstorming I recognised the underlying similarity in all three topics. I wanted to challenge the idea of memories and how our brain perceives as a combined topic and I wanted the outcome to start conversations or challenge a person’s perception. In the end, I came up with an almost open-ended idea on what I would like my speculative project to be. <br /> 

My idea was an immersive digital experience that somehow shows how our senses are related to our memories & how they can help evoke certain memories. It could be in the form of a data sculpture or painting, I wasn’t too fixated on setting the output design as of yet. <br /> 

The main inspiration that actually drove this idea was when I was walking on the street a few years back and walked past a man who had a similar cologne to the one my sister usually wears. The thing about my sister is that she rarely visits my family and I, and just that one whiff immediately brought me back a happy, nostalgic moment where I almost felt like I was back in that memory where she would come visit and we would have so much fun. <br /> 

But also in saying that, someone who sensed that smell could even had a completely different memory or feeling towards it, or maybe none at all. And I think that is what I find so interesting, how each person’s brain interprets stimuli differently based on that individual’s learning, memory, emotions, and expectations. <br /> 

I wanted this experience to show how we visually experience things through our senses, and how everyone has different perceptions to similar experiences. Maybe through this, people can understand how easily we can trick our brain or change our perspectives towards bad experiences? Or maybe even challenge the good ones?  <br /> 

I was also researching on artworks that provoked our senses, and I remember this one time I went to NGV and they had [smelling pods](https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/multimedia/sissel-tolaas/#:~:text=Sissel%20Tolaas-,NGV%20Triennial,memories%20of%20time%20and%20place.&text=The%20audience%20is%20invited%20to%20guess%20what%20each%20smell%20is.), where each pod gave off a different scent of the city of Melbourne. I thought this work was so interesting, and it actually gave me the hope that my idea was somewhat possible. <br />

<sub>This was just a miracle</sub>
<br /> <br /> 

I also found this [exhibition by Google in Milan](https://www.wallpaper.com/design/google-a-space-for-being-salone-del-mobile-2019), where they created three rooms of different interior designs. Users are prompted to wear this band that could track the feelings you receive upon exploring the different rooms, and could eventually tell you which room/ interior design is “healthiest” for you. <br /> 

Lauren Mccarthy’s [work](https://lauren-mccarthy.com/The-Changing-Room), “The Changing Room” also gave me the idea of maybe sharing or executing a concept as a group, instead of alone. I really like her ideas on social relationships and I thought this work really brought people together in an unimaginable way. I really liked how she created the smart environment that made everyone almost share the emotions together and to create that sort of wholesome experience. <br />

## In-Class Discussion

After we broke into groups, we discussed our ideas as a collective. As I was sharing my idea, my group mates sent a [resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_eOZuyCnnE) on a visual interface made by Yunsil Heo & Hyunwoo Bang, and what surprised me most of all was that it was made by Processing alone. I thought it was really interesting and was relieved to hear that something like a visual interface could be made through Processing alone (although of course, I know it won’t be easy). <br /> 

As I was discussing my idea with Karen as well, she mentioned my idea as some sort of multi dimensional memory bank, which I found super intriguing; the way it was phrased. She also suggested to watch some sci-fi virtual world films and even mentioned about Black Mirror, which is my favourite show of all time. Karen has also suggested so many creative outputs that I never thought of such as a mixed reality that could transport you into that memory or even an imaginative tool for creating your new ideas. <br /> 

I am really excited to see where this goes and am satisfied with the endless opportunities presented. <br />
