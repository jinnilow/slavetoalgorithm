### Discussions

In the smaller breakout groups, we discussed and shared the kind of sensors that we planned to use and how it would be implemented in our speculative project. It was really interesting to see everyone’s ideas and discuss what other sensors could be used, if not the ones that we initially planned on. 

My speculative project is quite ambitious as it includes an EEG sensor as well as a VR as a visual projector and I had no experience in any, so I was thinking of ways to scale it down. Karen suggested that I could enquire more about a facial tracking device, if not an EEG sensor and so I guess my next step would be to find alternatives as to how I would go about this speculative project.

### Paper Prototyping

The next exercise we did was a paper prototype to visually show how a 2D video game would work. I thought this exercise was actually pretty handy in showing how our tool could possibly function. I always feel that its easier to think how it would work in your head, but it would sometimes be really tough to explain it to someone who has no clue of what you’re on about and it also feels nice to visually see and experiment with something tangible. 

This is the paper prototype I did for Super Marios Bro.

### Karen's Presentation

Karen then did a presentation on artists that used tracking or sensor in their art pieces. The one that really stood out to me was [Michaela Gleave’s participative art based on celestial data.](https://michaelagleave.com/projects#/a-galaxy-of-suns-spectra/
) It was really refreshing to see an artist use the data not only digitally, but as a performance piece as well. She related the data to sound as an output but I like how she took into consideration of the whole atmosphere as well, maybe as a sign to represent the galaxy on planet earth. She also made it very accessible by creating a smartphone app for everyone to use, and so her inclusivity to enhance the user experience is also really inspiring.

It was also really interesting to see [Anouk Wipprecht & Viktoria Modesta’s Sonifica.](https://fashnerd.com/2017/08/anouk-wipprecht-sonifica-wearables-3d-printing/) I was watching the interview of the introduction to the new bionic, and she mentioned about how it was interesting to see this new fashion technology creating new identities for people. It was again, refreshing to see a new take on creative coding and a new way to represent identity. This made me think about the many ways coding art can be explored, not only through digitally but through 3D prints, performance art and even helping out in other apects; this new fashion piece could cater to the disabled and help reshape their fashion experiences.

Another one of the art pieces that stood out to me was [Stranger Visions by Heather Dewey-Hagborg.]( https://deweyhagborg.com/projects/stranger-visions) She made the artwork into an experience of really touching into humanity and connecting with strangers. I really like this sort of concept where it almost seem creepy and surreal. I am also really amazed with her trail of thoughts from collecting DNA to computationally generating 3d printed life size full color portraits. It is so interesting to see how science and art can be combined, and how the artist herself actually researched more about it by taking a crash course on biology. This created a new sense of respect as it shows how she really dug deep to understand and create the art she makes.
