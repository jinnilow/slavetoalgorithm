## Project Pitch - You Are Your Memories

### Brainstorm

Following my research from last week, I had to finalise what my speculative generative work would be. After reflecting on my discussion with Karen and my other course mates, I decided to brainstorm on the multiple possibilities of the potential machine/system.

<br /> <br /> 
Finally, I decided to go with an imaginative tool that allows you to visually create mental images through sensory experiences. Sort of like a multi dimensional memory bank projected through mixed reality.

The next step would be to research more on the topic & how this can be done, to further support my idea. 
<br /> <br /> 

### Further research on topic 

So I needed to research on how our senses are related to our memory, how this was all formed, artworks that have been produced through this and materials or tools needed for this tool to exist.

So through this [introductory Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s--bdwJ60Ks&t=284s) on our memories, I found a quote that was really intriguing. The quotes basically says “You Are Your Memories. You are what you have done; what you have done is in your memory; what you remember defines who you are.” This quote was defined by Dr Eric Kandel, the man who pioneered our understanding of the human brain. What is so interesting about this quote is how true it is and how much it makes you think about your memories.

<br /> <br /> 
Dr Eric Kandel also talks about sensitised experiences and how it creates physical changes which takes place in the nucleus cells. This leads to strengthened communication between cells which then leads to the formation of long term memories that not only sticks with you, but is you. 

We also have to become aware of the fact that each and everyday we are designing how we live our life through technology. 

When I researched on how our memories and senses are connected, I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-TTHK40u4w&t=60s) that talks about our taste and smell are related to our memories. In there, he brought up a very interesting example from Marcel Proust, who turns out to have created the Proust Effect which refers to the vivid reliving of events from the past through sensory stimuli. The one event that he experienced from eating a cake has brought him back a vivid childhood memory from 40 years ago. This made him wrote notes which have led to 7 volumes of what now seems to be his most prominent work, “In Search of Lost Time”. 

In this [Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4bGOvkkHcM) as well, as well, we learn about how sensory experiences play a huge role in creating memories or even deciding if a memory is good or bad, memorable or not.

### Research on artworks that have been produced with this idea.

Refik Anadol was one of the biggest inspiration for my work. After coming across him on [WIRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-EIVlHvHRM&t=3s), I just fell in love with the work he does through AI and machine intelligence. In this [work](http://refikanadol.com/works/melting-memories/), he carefully explains in the WIRED video as well, that he wanted to show a tangible feeling of how a memory forms or the act of remembering. The outcome turned out so engaging and so eye opening, I have never imagined for something so abstract like memory to have the potential to be formed to an augmented data sculpture. The way it moves and forms as well was created through data input from an EEG sensor where he recorded brain pulses of people remembering their childhood. I just cannot express how much I love this work. He also came to [NGV to talk about his work](https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/multimedia/in-the-minds-eye/) & I regret I didn’t know of him earlier.
<br /> <br /> 

<br /> <br /> 

Refik Anadol also had another work, [Virtual Archive](http://refikanadol.com/works/virtual-archive/) which allowed a user to explore a virtual space/ ‘data tunnel’ filed with documents present in SALT Research archive collections through VR. Users are able to go through this universe of images of information and are able to go through them and pick an information to read from. They are also allowed to switch universe and explore the different information present too. This gave me the inspiration of creating a multi dimensional space that could somehow shows all the different memories you have and you can select and pick an image and explore how the user might have felt then.

Oskar Fischinger is a German-American abstract animator, filmmaker, and painter who was known for creating abstract animations way before the appearance of computer graphics. I was introduced to this artist in my elective (Video Art) and I was again really interested in his work. It was really inspiring to see how he created all these kind of animations before the existence of required technology these days. [Optical Poems](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6wte7p), was so interesting as he conveys the mental images of music in a visual form. It contains very simple shapes dancing to the rhythm of the music, but it amazingly conveys the images he had in his head while listening to the music evolve. He also created many [artworks for Disney](https://animationfinalproject.tumblr.com/post/619314084665491456/examples-of-abstract-animation-appearing-in) as well.

[This random artwork based on brainwaves](https://mashable.com/2017/06/24/brainwaves-painting-eeg-art-memories-emotions/) was also a really good example of how one can use an EEG sensor to create artworks. 

The process was that through the numbers (data input) from the EEG sensor, Theodoros Papatheodorou and Tom Chambers divide these numbers into two variants - valence and excitement activity, to map the feelings of the person in what is called the Geneva Emotion Wheel, which contains all the human emotions.

So, they take all the data from the EEG and then process it down to emotions. Then, they get scores of each emotion, pick two of the most probable ones, assign a colour to each particle, and the data starts painting like brush strokes.

Yuichi Ikehata is an artist who explores the concept of memory as well, and how he views them as fragments. I admire how futuristic his [sculptures]( https://www.ignant.com/2017/04/10/disturbing-works-of-yuichi-ikehata/) look and how the artists again visualises something so abstract into something so real. It almost reminds me of the movie Inception, when pieces of the memory starts falling apart. The scary part of his work is that he adds realistic parts to his sculptures such as skin, eyes, hair and nails.

In Blade Runner 2049 we also see the existence of the two machines (that of course, haven't yet existed in this world) that is able to look into your memory just by the person recalling it as well as a memory maker which can be visualised like a holographic.
