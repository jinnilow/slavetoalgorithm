# Week 13

## Final Sketch

Here is the [link to my final sketch](https://jinnilow.github.io/slavetoalgorithm/MEMCO_JINNI/)~ 

I have honestly poured my blood, sweat and tears into refining everything in the final week, I am so proud that I pulled through. If I had more time though, I definitely would’ve used the text function to maybe enable users to give their memories a title, or included sound as well for each emotion, and increase the volume as users use the sliders for each emotion. I also wanted to project the sketch onto a wall, but didn’t have time to carry this out. I still plan to though, after submission and can’t wait to improve this sketch further :)
