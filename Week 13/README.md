# Week 13

## Final Sketch

Here is the [link to my final sketch](https://jinnilow.github.io/slavetoalgorithm/MEMCO_JINNI/)~ 
You can also [view the code here](https://github.com/jinnilow/slavetoalgorithm/tree/master/MEMCO_JINNI).

I have honestly poured my blood, sweat and tears into refining everything in the final week, I am so proud that I pulled through. If I had more time though, I definitely would’ve used the text function to maybe enable users to give their memories a title, or included sound as well for each emotion, and increase the volume as users use the sliders for each emotion. I also wanted to project the sketch onto a wall, but didn’t have time to carry this out. I still plan to though, after submission and can’t wait to improve this sketch further :)


## Reflection

In my second year, I remember looking at [MIT’s Media Lab branding](https://www.pentagram.com/work/mit-media-lab), thinking to myself how amazing the work was. I couldn’t even put a name to what it was and how they were designing so many iterations, but I knew that it was something that I wanted to speculate more on. Before starting Slave To Algorithm, I was also looking at a few recommended links to look at, one of it being [field.io's website](https://www.field.io/). When I saw what they were doing, I immediately knew that that was the direction that I wanted to take in terms of design, and seeing how futuristic everything was really made me fall in love with the algorithm. 

Generative design has made me aware of the many possible directions that I can take with my designs and practice. I have never imagined myself being able to do creative coding, but now that I have successfully created a generative system, I find that working with algorithms can be so beneficial for
designers, especially in terms of creating multiple iterations and making sure the end result is foolproof. 

This studio has pushed me in so many ways as well, and I am really grateful to have had started on creative coding, even to coding an entire functioning website. I feel like the process can be so mentally stimulating and definitely draining at the same time, but the outcome is so very rewarding. I have learnt so many functions and terms and layers to p5js as well as Processing, and I feel like this is just the beginning of something amazing.

Learning about parametric systems and how we are carrying it out every day in our daily acitivities, generative design and the huge potential it brings, how an algorithm works and how to implement them in code… There have just been so much of learning and developing throughout these 12 weeks and I am so proud that we have all made it.

I am really glad to have been introduced to so many amazing artists as well that have implemented their own algorithmic system in their art pieces and exhibitions; this gives me the drive and motivation to create more, to speculate more into this field of design and to continue being inspired.

Lastly, I just want to thank Karen and Andy for this amazing studio! None of this amazing stuff would’ve happened without the both of you, so thank you for being so patient and kind with all of us and for structuring the studio so well. The both of you have been amazing role models throughout my journey in RMIT, and I really hope to see the both of you again in the near future.
