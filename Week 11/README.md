# Week 11

## Sketch Progress

So from the trialling of animations that I have been doing over the past week, here is my current progress.

Althought I have only managed to finalise the visual for love, trauma and sadness, I still feel like something is not working with the sketch in terms of the visuals. It doesn't feel as united as I think I have been viewing each feeling as a separate object, and I didn't think about how everything would look together. It almost feels like a mess and I was worried if I should maybe think of other alternatives for the visuals.

My alternatives would be either to:

1. Set a fixed object like a blob and use each feeling to determine the speed or texture of an object, so that the final outcome would look more neat, instead of a whole bunch of random objects.

2. Simplify the animations into singular shapes and colours to make the final outcome look more cohesive.

3. Have 2 different pages (so that it almost looks like a book spread), and have text on right side and visuals on the other.

## In Class Feedback

My feedback session with Karen and Andy were really insightful and I managed to gain a lot of helpful advise as to how I can go forward with this project. This helped me reallign my thoughts as I was going to switch my project completely.

Karen's suggestions were:

1. Improve user experience by creating a few pages to prompt the user on each feeling/ guide the user into the generated visual instead of having sliders. Could still have the sliders at the very end to allow users to adjust their feelings if needed, or for them just to have a go with it.

2. Could have user type in their memory first then prompt them based on a scale from 1-10 on how strongly they feel about each feeling.

3. Could play around with different fonts & textures for different emotions as well to add some dynamicity to the final outcome. 
<br/> 

Andy's suggestions were:

1. Could still have the animations I made but maybe frame them a bit better with the user interface design. Opportunity to design around the chaos. 
[Here is the example Andy gave.](https://www.eliashanzer.com/phase/)

2. Encouraged to still use animations but maybe rethink the connection of each element to the feelings stated. Do they represent each feeling well enough? 

3. Have a go with playing around with the typeface and giving them more character.

## Inspiration

When I thought about Karen's suggestions, I ran across this spread and thought about how nice it would be if I could separate the text and visual element into a spread and have the algorithm spread the text into different paragraphs or even randomising it across the page. I was also thinking if the visuals could be this abstract, so instead of being quite literal with the translation of the feelings, to make it abstract with maybe different colours and brush strokes to represent each feeling.

After my consultation with Andy about this, he did mention that it is quite hard to make it into a spread, and that it would be better to focus on making the layout across the webpage instead of separating it into two different pages across one page. 

I still really like the idea of having abstract pieces coming together to form one full painting, so I might maybe trial that out or even maybe continuing what I have but refining it a lot more. I will definitely have to work on the user experience and the text input by the coming week.
