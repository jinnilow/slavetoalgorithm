# Week 9

## Milestone Review

### In Class Activity

This week we shared our work with other students and in class as well. Through sharing with other students, I found out that my code doesn't really function as well on Safari, and so I learnt how to create a general Github website for the code instead. It was really refreshing to see other students' works and to share the knowledge as well. There was a [code that I learnt the past week that helped set a landing page to enhance the user experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgHhEzKlLb4), and  I was glad that I could share it with the rest of the team as well.

I had a few basic visuals done for the emotions (anxious, excited, happy), and had received feedback from the group as well. It seems like the visuals for anxious and excited works well, but not so much for happiness- and so I will have to improve the visual for this.

Following Karen's feedback as well, I think I will have to play around more with the animations in terms of colours and shape to make it more dynamic, but also keep it still related to the emotions.
