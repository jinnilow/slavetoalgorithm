# Week 7 Content
## Rethinking the Brief

[A quick recapture of my initial project](https://github.com/jinnilow/slavetoalgorithm/blob/master/Week%205/README.md) - I wanted to create a tool which would visually project a memory through our sensory experiences. But of course, looking at the timeframe, possibility of the project & the feedback as well, I decided to think of other ways I could carry out the idea without the use of VR and the EEG sensor. Essentially, the project still has to 
1. Trigger memories through sensory experiences.
2. Generate an artwork/ visual output based on the experience.

### Brainstorm

Yasmin and I brainstormed a few ideas that I could do for my project. 

The first idea was to use a [DIY cardboard VR headset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asITXtq3iEg) to visually project the memory. Users should be able to input what they are thinking of through some sort of text input, and that should generate a visual/ artwork in the VR world. As I was quite unsure of how to connect everything together and honestly did not want to do VR, I decided to move on to the next idea.

As I was discussing this with Yasmin, she brought up a point about how we usually can’t rely on our memories because some parts of it might not have even happened, but it’s usually the feeling/emotion that you remember from it. This gave me the idea to focus more on the emotions then, and possibly use face tracking as a device track the user’s emotions.

So we thought of a web-based project that would help with memory building. First, the user has to trigger a memory through any chosen sensory experiences in their own space. Then, the tool could possibly facial track users as they think of a memory and guess the emotions that they are feeling. The tool will then prompt open-ended questions that will guide them through the process of remembering, and the end result would be sort of this 3D visualised trail of thought. As they click onto each point of their trail of thought, they will be able to see a part of their memory. This would also be helpful for people that might’ve had traumatic incidents, so they will not have to visually relive the whole experience again, but could instead confront the emotions linked to the incident from a new perspective.
