# Week 7 Content
## Rethinking the Brief

[A quick recapture of my initial project](https://github.com/jinnilow/slavetoalgorithm/blob/master/Week%205/README.md) - I wanted to create a tool which would visually project a memory through our sensory experiences. But of course, looking at the timeframe, possibility of the project & the feedback as well, I decided to think of other ways I could carry out the idea without the use of VR and the EEG sensor. Essentially, the project still has to 
1. Trigger memories through sensory experiences.
2. Generate an artwork/ visual output based on the experience.
