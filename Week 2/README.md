## 12 Hour Challenge

Before our class, we were given a task to create an algorithm that will help or challenge the rhythm of our daily tasks. 
And for this, I have chosen to include an algorithm in the way I select my music. <br />

So with this algorithm, I was able to roll a dice and let the algorithm pick a music streaming site, genre, playlist, & even decide the amount of skips I am allowed to have if I didn't like the song. It was a really interesting process and I felt like I could have extended it to other parts of my day. For instance, time of day where I will listen to music, or the amount of time I would have to listen to the chosen playlist or maybe even to whether I would have to listen to music on that particular day. It was an interesting experience for me and I felt as if using an algorithm could really help with decision based processes especially if you are an indecisive person. <br />

As for the outcome, I ended up listening to classical tunes on iHeart Radio. <br />

## In Class Activity

In this class, we learnt how to code basic shapes and trigger some form of interaction in Processing. Learning how to code basic shapes was fine, but learning how to work out the maths for certain animation is somewhat tricky. In this activity, we used what we learned in class to create a self portrait through Processing. 

Attached below is my self portrait. I coded this so that there would be a background change whenever you move your cursor. The task itself made me learn how to code  different shapes like an arc and a triangle, which was really interesting to figure/ understand how each shape has a different parameter.

<br />
I then remixed Yasmin's static portrait so that there would be a background change, and that the flowers will rotate whenever the cursor moves as well. It was super interesting to figure out how to make sure the three flower rotations would stay in their respective places. I then found the resetMatrix(); function, which resets each translation, so it would be possible to do multiple translations and rotations which I thought was really enlightening.

## Artist Research

As I was browsing through Youtube, I came across this WIRED video -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-EIVlHvHRM , which talks about how the artist Refik Anadol uses AI to create these massive installation art & designs. I was so drawn to his work, and I loved how intriguing he made something so boring (data), look. He mentioned about how the data we leave behind are memories of humanity, and that stuck with me. He also questioned what then, can we do with the data given? <br />

I was genuinely amazed with the artworks generated by his studio and I love how they integrate parametric, algorithms & data into something so truly beautiful and mesmerizing. https://refikanadolstudio.com/projects/<br />

Looking at these artworks have also inspired me to gear my project towards installation art pieces, although I will try to keep my options open. The installation artworks provide such a captivating method of communication between the audience and data science. As a visual learner myself, I feel good when I see something filled with so much information translated into something so visually intriguing, as that helps me understand the data better. I believe and hope that this would possibly transform the learning experience for the future.
