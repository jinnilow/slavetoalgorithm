# Week 10
## Sketch Progress

Throughout the week I have been learning the noise() and paticles() function as planned. I wanted to experiment the different types of animations that I can do with the function and came across [this Coding Train tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5QBExMNB1I&t=369s) that talked about the [mathematical rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(mathematics)), which basically uses a set formula to create dynamic flower patterns.

Here's my progress.

<br /> <br /> 

There was another [mathematical flower formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurer_rose) that I tried as well. The fill looks really interesting but I felt that the other one would suit the idea or feeling of 'love' more than this one.

<br /> <br /> 

I then decided to combine both mathematical roses together to see how it would look. I made the Maurer Rose more thin so that the other rose would be more visible. I also added a speed function that animates both roses according to the speed, although this was too quick.
<br /> <br /> 
                    
<br /> <br /> 

This is after slowing down the speed and changing the colours as the orange looked too dull.

Discovering the HSB colour mode function and managed to create a more dynamic colour set. I have also messed around with the noise() function to create grains as a texture for trauma.

<br /> <br /> 

I have also trialed with different patterns like the [Phyllotaxis pattern](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch4.pdf), using a set mathematical formula again.

<br /> <br /> 

The only problem was that I couldn't get it to erase or return to 0 when I slide the slider back to 0..
