# Week 10
## Sketch Progress

Throughout the week I have been learning the noise() and paticles() function as planned. I wanted to experiment the different types of animations that I can do with the function and came across [this Coding Train tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5QBExMNB1I&t=369s) that talked about the [mathematical rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(mathematics)), which basically uses a set formula to create dynamic flower patterns.

Here's my progress.

<br /> <br /> 

There was another [mathematical flower formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurer_rose) that I tried as well. The fill looks really interesting but I felt that the other one would suit the idea or feeling of 'love' more than this one.

<br /> <br /> 

I then decided to combine both mathematical roses together to see how it would look. I made the Maurer Rose more thin so that the other rose would be more visible. I also added a speed function that animates both roses according to the speed, although this was too quick.
<br /> <br /> 
              
<br /> <br /> 

This is after slowing down the speed and changing the colours as the orange looked too dull.

<br /> <br /> 

Discovering the HSB colour mode function and managed to create a more dynamic colour set. I have also messed around with the noise() function to create grains as a texture for trauma.

<br /> <br /> 

I have also trialed with different patterns like the [Phyllotaxis pattern](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch4.pdf), using a set mathematical formula again.

<br /> <br /> 

The only problem was that I couldn't get it to erase or return to 0 when I slide the slider back to 0. 
<br /> <br /> 

<br /> <br /> 


I had a similar problem with the sadness visual. I wanted to create these rain looking visuals that had trails to them and so I used the blend() function. However, when I used the slider, it couldn't erase the previous steps and just stopped the sketch until I moved the slider back on again.
<br /> <br /> 

<br /> <br /> 

I ended up erasing the trail and using blue ellipses as the sadness visual. It was really interesting to learn the velocity as well as the gravity function, and how that can really create a difference in the sketch.
<br /> <br /> 

<br /> <br /> 


This was another idea I had as a visual for the feeling of anger.
<br /> <br />

Here are my experimentations with the noise() function. All credits go to [The Coding Challenge #24: Perlin Noise Flow Field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY). I have learned so much from the one video.
