# Week 10
## Sketch Progress

Throughout the week I have been learning the noise() and paticles() function as planned. I wanted to experiment the different types of animations that I can do with the function and came across [this Coding Train tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5QBExMNB1I&t=369s) that talked about the [mathematical rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(mathematics)), which basically uses a set formula to create dynamic flower patterns.

Here's my progress.

There was another [mathematical flower formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurer_rose) that I tried as well. The fill looks really interesting but I felt that the other one would suit the idea or feeling of 'love' more than this one.
